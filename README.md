<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a _work in progress_ to allow me to practive coding in a realm that I have not been able to do before, while simultaneously exploring an area that intrigues me as a numberphile. I am most comfortable with `C`, so I have begun there and am going to explore the usage of things such as `SIMD` and `AVX` instructions, loop unraveling, and any other optimizations that I can to improve the efficency. With that, I will attempt to translate the same level of functionality to Python, which is a language I hope to become more familiar with using. Due to Python's slowness, I will use the Numpy library. Eventually, I would like to be able to write this in `CUDA` so I can run the iteration task as the kernal and parrallelize the operations even more, so that multiple-gigapixel images become feasible.
      
I chose the Mandelbrot set originally not for its simplicity to generate with code, but because I am fascianted with its connections to the Fibonacci Sequence and Logistic Map, and how each of those is delicately itertwined with nature. **Math is beautiful and scary.**


### Built With

* CLion
* Visual Studio 2019



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

To view the output `.ppm` files:
* [Netpbm Viewer](http://paulcuth.me.uk/netpbm-viewer/)
  
**Others N/A (Just yet)**

### Installation

1. Clone the repo into the desired directory
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pinecone19/Gigabrot.git
   ```
2. Open the directory from within CLion


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. In `stripedMan.c`, modify the `iXmax` and `iYmax` (Resolution) and `IterationMax` parameters to the desired values.

2. Build and run the project in CLion.

3. Once the code has finished running, the output `mandelbrot.ppm` can be found within the `cmake-build` or `cmake-build-debug` directory.

4. Drag and drop this file into [Netpbm Viewer](http://paulcuth.me.uk/netpbm-viewer/).

5. If this file is to your liking, download the `.png` file.
